<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Troponin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laboratory Testing</li><li>Point-of-care Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac troponin market is divided into two primary types: laboratory testing and point-of-care testing (POCT). Laboratory testing involves analyzing blood samples in centralized facilities, providing accurate and reliable results for diagnosing heart conditions, but may take longer for results. In contrast, point-of-care testing allows immediate assessment at the patient's location, delivering quick results for rapid decision-making in emergency settings. Both testing types cater to different clinical needs, enhancing the overall management of cardiovascular diseases.</p></p>
